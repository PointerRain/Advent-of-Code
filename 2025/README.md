# Advent of Code 2025
Puzzles are solved using Python 3.11.

Each day has its own directory `DayN` with a `dayN.py` file that contains the solution when I solved it,
with only minimal cleanup;
as well as a `dayN_complete.py` file, which contains code that I wrote after the fact,
simplifying and optimising it in a way I find interesting (usually for the fewest lines).
Additionally, there is a `dayN.txt` file that contains the input for that day, and `dayN_test.txt` that contains the test input.

## Times
| Day | Star 1   | Star 2   | Total    |
|-----|----------|----------|----------|
| 1   | 00:04:23 | 00:02:55 | 00:07:18 |
| 2   | 00:05:51 | 00:11:00 | 00:16:51 |
| 3   | 00:08:27 | 00:13:55 | 00:22:22 |
| 4   | 00:04:37 | 00:03:07 | 00:07:44 |
| 5   | 00:04:03 | 00:19:02 | 00:23:05 |
| 6   | 00:08:14 | 00:28:41 | 00:36:55 |
| 7   | 00:07:52 | 00:00:27 | 00:08:19 |
| 8   | 01:42:49 | 00:04:24 | 01:47:13 |

## Use of AI
GitHub Copilot inline suggestions were used at times while solving puzzles, however Copilot Chat and other generative AI software were never used while solving puzzles.

GitHub Copilot Chat was used at times to simplify the code after the fact in the `dayN_complete.py` files.

# Desmos
After solving in Python, I sometimes attempt the puzzles in Desmos for fun, also attempting to use the fewest lines.
